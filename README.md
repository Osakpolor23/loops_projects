# Loop-Based Projects in Python
This repository contains five Python projects, each showcasing the practical use of loops in solving diverse problems. From vending machine simulations to variable name conversions, these projects demonstrate how iterations can be harnessed to tackle real-world challenges efficiently.

## Projects Overview

### **1. nutrition.py**
**Description:** A program that calculates the nutritional value of foods by referencing a predefined nutrition database. Users input food items, and the program uses loops to fetch calorie values.

**Sample Input:**

    Enter food item: Apple
**Expected Output:**

    Calories: 95

### **2. camel.py**
**Description:** This program converts variable names from camelCase to snake_case. It identifies uppercase letters in the input and replaces them with underscores followed by their lowercase equivalent.

**Sample Input:**

    camelCase: myVariableName
**Expected Output:**

    snake_case: my_variable_name

### **3. twttr.py**
**Description:** Inspired by Twitter's character limit, this program removes all vowels from a user-provided string, leaving only consonants and non-vowel symbols.

**Sample Input:**

    Input: Twitter AI Rocks!
**Expected Output:**

    Twttr  Rcks!

### **4. coke.py**
**Description:** A vending machine simulator for Coca-Cola. Users insert coins until the total cost (50 cents) is covered. The program accepts valid denominations (50, 25, 10, and 5 cents) and calculates change if the user pays more than required.

**Sample Interaction:**

    Amount Due: 50
    Insert Coin: 25
    Amount Due: 25
    Insert Coin: 25
    Change Owed: 0

### **5. plates.py**
**Description:** A program that validates license plate numbers based on predefined criteria (e.g., format, length). Loops are used to check compliance with specified rules.

**Sample Input:**

    Enter plate: AB1234
**Expected Output:**

    Valid plate.
